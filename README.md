# WorkBuddies
NSS Server Side Capstone

## Description

This project constitutes my first full stack web application, utilizing .NET Web API, Firebase authentication, and React js. Work Buddies allows workers, or "buddies", regardless of their company, industry, or role to form working groups, or "packs", in the interest of fostering workplace camaraderie and community even in situations of hybrid or fully remote work. Individual packs register their "hangouts," or meet-up places, which may be shared across packs. "Vibes", or tags, may be given to packs by their pack mood or best-fit consideration. Users may search for packs to join by filtering for cities or companies of users associated with these packs, or else hangouts or vibes associated with these packs.

## Use
1. Login or register
2. Choose the "Form a Pack" link in the navbar to form and automatically join your own pack.
3. Choose the "Find a Pack" or "Find by Vibe" links to search other packs, and join them.
4. From your profile, view and edit your user information, joined packs, and associated hangouts. You may view but not edit other buddies' profile pages.
5. Click on Pack details anywhere packs are listed to see Pack information, schedules of meet-ups, including options to join or leave pack.

## To Do
1. Buddy should be able to add vibes to hangouts, as well, and search by vibes in both hangouts and packs.
2. Implement a "pack founder" status accorded automatically to pack formers but also assignable to other users. Pack Founder status includes the ability to open or close membership, and to add or delete a hangout, which privileges are currently given to all members of a pack.
3. Create a dynamic scheduling interface for adding, editing, and removing hangout meeting times. I want it, as well, to track possible conflicts with other packs.
4. Image upload rather than, or else in addition to, image url.
